 	<h4>----Jenny Picking Cockles/ The Collier's (Reels, 2002)----</h4>
	<p>Two fairly common reels learned from the wonderful book 'The Dance Music of Willie Clancy' by Pat Mitchell. Lucky enough to be given the opportunity to record these tunes on Niamh Parsons' album 'Heart's Desire', Dennis Cahill's first production, and wonderfully accompanied here by the one and the same man.</p>
