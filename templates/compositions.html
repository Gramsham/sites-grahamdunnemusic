	<h4>----Murmuration No.1 (July, 2016)----</h4>
	<p>This composition is an improvisation between the composer on tabla, and an A.I. (Artificial Life) algorithm imitating the flight of birds on piano. The algorithm was created in Java and the piece was realised in Ableton Live.</p>

 	<h4>----Are You Waiting For Me To Sing? (August, 2014)----</h4>
	<p>This was originally a 5.1 surround sound piece for my thesis in 2014, and is here presented in stereo format. The piece was a study of gesture in composition and seemed like a good excuse to use an off-the-cuff remark caught on tape whilst recording the vocals for 'Kind Providence'. At seven minutes long, every single sound heard is derived from the first couple of syllables heard in the opening statement.</p>

 	<h4>----Time is in the Ting (October, 2013)----</h4>
	<p>Originally a classroom exercise designed to create a piece of 'tape' music, or musique concrète, this piece uses samples recorded using a waterproof microphone. The mic was frozen in a small container of water which was then put into a pot of hot water and the defrosting process is what was recorded. After that, some Solpadeine dissolving in a glass of water provided the second sample. It's not everyday we get to hear life inside a defrosting ice-cube!</p>

 	<h4>----The Lost Arpeggio (March, 2012)----</h4>
	<p>Composed and recorded while supposed to have been studying, this is Graham checking out a Taylor acoustic guitar that he eventually purchased from a friend whilst living in the beautiful County Clare.</p>
